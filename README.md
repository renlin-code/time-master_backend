# time-master_backend
This is the backend web service of my to-do application "Time Master".  In this app you can create your own user profile, keep track of your daily tasks and organize them by categories.  For this service I used Express, PostgresSQL and ORM Sequelize.  Also for the authentication and authorization middleware I used JWT and Passport JS
